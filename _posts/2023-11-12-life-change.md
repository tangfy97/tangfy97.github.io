As the leaves turn golden and the autumn wind whispers through the streets, it's hard not to reflect on the changes life brings. The transformation from the intense solitude of PhD studies to the dynamic pulse of the industry feels much like the transition from the endless rain and wind of a Dutch autumn to the early snows blanketing Norway.

深秋时节，荷兰的街道已被黄褐色斑驳的树叶覆盖；而在北海对岸的挪威，朋友圈里已经分享着奥斯陆大雪纷飞的景象。这是我离开挪威后的第一个秋冬。尽管荷兰风雨交加的冬天常被人诟病，但相比挪威，我似乎还未真正感受到冬日的严寒。这样的反差让我不禁思考：在博士生涯结束后的这三个月里，我都经历了些什么？我的生活变了吗？

During my PhD, days and nights melded into one in the quiet corners of libraries and labs. It was a world of solitary pursuit, where the rhythm of falling leaves outside mirrored the steady pace of research within. There's a unique kind of peace in this academic solitude, though it's often accompanied by a sense of isolation as profound as the quiet before a snowfall.

回想博士三年，其中有一年半是在疫情断断续续的封锁中度过的。那时，生活就是家、办公室和图书馆之间的三点一线。我还记得，在办公室暖气片旁，我无数次地凝视着窗外缓缓落下的雪花发呆，或是望着满天落叶，心中感慨着何时才能得到满意的实验结果。博士生涯的确教会了我如何静心，尽管生活看似平淡，但持续不断的压力和孤独感，是这三年留给我的最深刻的印象。

Contrast that with life in the industry. It's as lively and interconnected as a bustling autumn market, where every stall buzzes with activity. Here, teamwork is the heartbeat of progress – a far cry from the lone-wolf approach of academic research. This shift to a collaborative environment is as refreshing as the first snowflake of the Norwegian winter.

业界与学术界迥然不同。与读博时可以在一个小问题上执着焦虑数周不同，业界的节奏不容许如此。然而，尽管业界步伐匆忙，却仿佛欧洲圣诞市场般热闹喧嚣，充满了团队合作的温暖。在这三个月中，我从未独自一人面对困难。每当遇到挑战，总有同事在身后支持和帮助，弥补我的不足。我非常感激我的团队，他们营造的这种互帮互助的氛围，就像奥斯陆冬日里第一片轻轻飘落的雪花，给人以清新之感。

Moving from the Netherlands to Norway brought its own set of changes, much like the shift in seasons. In the Netherlands, the cultural landscape is as varied and vibrant as an autumn forest. People are eager to explore and experience, much like tasting different flavors at an autumn harvest festival. Their curiosity and openness are as pervasive as the autumn rain.

In Norway, the approach is more akin to the early winter snow – a blanket of comfort and familiarity. There's a gentle appreciation for what's known and loved, a quiet contentment in the familiar, much like enjoying a warm drink by the fire as snow gently covers the world outside.

尽管这不是我第一次来到荷兰，但这三个月的深入工作体验让我深切感受到了荷兰与挪威的差异。荷兰人对不同文化的好奇心旺盛，对独特的人和事充满探索欲。虽然他们有时可能无意间流露出内心的偏见，但至少对文化多样性的存在持开放态度。这与挪威形成鲜明对比。挪威人通常展现友善和包容的姿态，但在面对非熟悉文化时，他们往往自然而然地产生抵触，习惯于忽视或否认与自身主流价值观不符的事物。常常作为游客来北欧时，人们会被当地人的随和和友善所感动，但真正深入了解后，便会发现北欧文化中隐藏的保守与冷漠，如同格陵兰的冰盖，无法被任何人的温暖融化。

## Embracing Each Season
This journey, from academia to industry and from the snowy Nordic to windy lowlands, has been a path of growth and discovery. It’s been a journey through different seasons of life, each with its unique beauty and challenges.

Here's to embracing the beauty of each season, to learning and growing, and to finding joy in both the familiar and the new.

从学术界到业界，从北欧之旅再至西欧，这一路的蜿蜒使我深感：终究又回到了欧洲的起点。记得四五年前，我从新西兰这太平洋的一隅起航，经过30多小时的长途跋涉，抵达初秋的比利时，欧洲的心脏。如今，秋意正浓之际，我再次踏足西欧，回归荷语区的怀抱。命运似乎总在与我们玩着捉迷藏，我所能做的，便是在这场游戏中寻找最大的快乐。
