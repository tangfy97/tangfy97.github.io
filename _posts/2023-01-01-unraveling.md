As we collectively emerge from a year of profound changes, there's a palpable yearning amongst many of us to rekindle our relationship with the wider world, to immerse ourselves in the unfamiliar, and to satiate our wanderlust. I was fortunate enough to embark on a series of memorable journeys in 2022, which I hope to share with you not merely as travelogues, but as a tapestry of reflections and insights that these experiences evoked in me.

My first sojourn took me to Pafos, Cyprus in the chilly month of February. The city, a sentinel of time, houses some of the most remarkable archaeological relics in the Mediterranean, leaving me in awe of the human propensity to create and persevere. As I wandered through the Tombs of the Kings, a UNESCO World Heritage site, the intricate frescoes whispered tales from epochs gone by, reminding me of the transient nature of our existence. However, Pafos was more than just a journey through history. The beaches, with their shimmering sands and turquoise waters, were a testament to the timeless beauty of nature. They offered me serene moments of respite where I could bask in the sunlight and let the world fade into a tranquil blur.

As spring breathed life into the world, I embarked on an Easter journey to the enchanting towns of Dubrovnik, Mostar, and Kotor on the Balkan coast. Each town had its own unique rhythm, its own tapestry of life unfurling in winding alleyways and sun-dappled squares. Dubrovnik, the "Pearl of the Adriatic," was a symphony of antiquity and aesthetics. Its formidable city walls and centuries-old streets were a testament to human resilience and creativity, while Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kotor in Montenegro, offered me a kaleidoscope of cultures, each distinct yet harmonious in their own right.

The summer of 2022 saw me embarked on a 5-week train odyssey across the heart of Europe, leading me to the unexpected revelation of Slovenia. A modest-sized country, Slovenia humbly unveiled an expanse of natural splendour, from the imposing Julian Alps to the ethereal beauty of Lake Bled. Each landscape served as a reminder of nature's grandeur and our humble place within it. Ljubljana, the country's capital, was an endearing blend of charm and gastronomic delight, leaving an indelible imprint on my senses.

The year culminated in a rewarding work experience in the Netherlands, an enlightening journey into a culture marked by openness and pragmatism. Living amidst the Dutch was a testament to their liberal ethos and the seamless blend of functionality and aesthetics that the country embodies. The efficient public transportation and the weekend bustle of the shops further accentuated the harmony of Dutch life.

In sharing these experiences, I hope to have painted a vivid canvas of my 2022 travels, to inspire not just a desire to visit these incredible destinations but also to explore the inner landscapes these journeys can reveal. Whether you are drawn to the echoes of history, the allure of sun-kissed beaches, or the transformative power of cultural immersion, each journey offers myriad opportunities for self-discovery. As for me, I'm eagerly awaiting the new horizons that await to be explored, the new narratives that are yet to be woven.
