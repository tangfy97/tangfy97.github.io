In the realm of computer science, we often say that experience is the best teacher. But in the context of job hunting in Norway in 2023, I'd say that experience is not just a teacher but also a comedy writer, a plot twist generator, and a tough-love mentor. Buckle up; you're in for a ride.

## Act I: The TietoEVRY Tango
First on the list was TietoEVRY, a Nordic software colossus. During the initial interview, the recruiter suggested a salary of around 500k NOK gross (approximately 40k Euros). Though a lowball offer, desperation was my middle name given the current economy. I proceeded to the managerial stage, where the department head greeted me with this gem: "Why did you study computer science for your master's and then pivot to philosophy for your current degree?" My jaw dropped faster than a poorly optimized algorithm. Two weeks later, I was courteously informed that the role went to someone with "leadership experience." Clearly, 500k NOK buys you top-tier management skills in Norway!

## Act II: Solar Start-up Shenanigans
Next stop was a solar energy startup, a more vibrant setting but not without its quirks. I was tasked with a labor-intensive project that devoured hours like a greedy algorithm. Following a jovial final presentation, the team disclosed they were freezing tech hires due to restructuring. Seven months later, the vacancy still haunts their careers page. My project, much like their hiring plans, had sunk into a black hole.

## Act III: The Wilhelmsen Whirlpool
March ushered in Wilhelmsen, a maritime industry titan. The experience was something to behold. After being unofficially offered a role, an HR representative called to tell me, "Let's keep it *tentative*." Her BBC accent didn't make the statement any more genuine. Upon pressing, she revealed the real issue: **visa sponsorship**. This was after assuring her that my permanent residency was underway. To top it off, they hired a Norwegian with a business background who started in August 2023 - after my permanent residency would've come through. His qualifications? Business operations, MS Office, and presumably, Norwegian citizenship. (oh yes, he listed *MS Office* next to *Machine Learning* as his skills :p)

## Act IV: ABB's Anti-Climax
ABB beckoned next. After two rounds of interviews and reaching the final stage in April, the process stalled. Emails flowed in stating, "Management is still reviewing the role." If management approval was a prerequisite, why hold interviews in the first place? Then in late August, I received the call: "We did not find anyone suitable, so we're not hiring." A fittingly absurd end to a bewildering experience.

## The Moral of the Story
If you're a non-EU fresh graduate in Norway, you'll find the job market is a harder nut to crack than the **P versus NP** problem. The situation worsens if you're like me - an Asian, with B1-level Norwegian proficiency, fluency in English, and a Norwegian PhD on the horizon. Even the IT sector, traditionally seen as a global melting pot, is surprisingly insular here.

## Conclusion: Lessons Learned and Unlearned
Thank you, Norway, for an unforgettable experience that I will cherish right alongside my toughest debugging sessions. To other job seekers in this peculiar landscape, I can only offer this: Your technical chops may get your foot in the door, but you'll need a masterful blend of cultural and linguistic navigation to fully enter the room.

Takk for n√•, Norge. You've been an invaluable `NullPointerException` in the Java program of my life.
