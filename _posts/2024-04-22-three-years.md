在2019年的冬天，我从新西兰的温暖气候中挥手告别，搬到了比利时的鲁汶，一座古老而宁静的城市，这里的荷语天主教大学将是我新的求学之地。我不知道，这一次的迁移，将是我人生中最重大的转变之一。

In the winter of 2019, I bade farewell to the balmy climes of New Zealand and moved to Leuven, a city steeped in tranquility and history in Belgium. Here, at KU Leuven, I was to embark on a new chapter in my educational journey - one that would turn out to be a significant pivot in my life.


2020年的初冬，我在鲁汶的第一个学期就要结束时，一场突如其来的疫情悄无声息地席卷全球。随着封城的落下，原本熙熙攘攘的城市瞬间安静了下来，生活和学习都被迫进入了一种全新的模式。在这一年，我在不确定和孤独中度过了许多日夜，也在此期间申请了多个博士项目。从莱顿到维也纳，再到布鲁塞尔，各地的offer纷至沓来，其中最让我心动的是来自奥斯陆的欧盟玛丽居里项目，虽然我们未能面对面参加招聘会议，但这一切的不易与期待，构成了我记忆中难以抹去的一部分。

As my first semester in Leuven drew to a close in early winter 2020, a silent and sudden pandemic swept across the globe. Lockdown measures brought the bustling city to a hushed standstill, forcing life and study into a new, unexpected mold. During this year of isolation and uncertainty, I spent many nights contemplating my future, applying to several PhD programs. From Leiden to Vienna to Brussels, offers came pouring in, but it was the offer from a Marie Curie program in Oslo that truly captured my heart, even though we could not meet in person for the interviews. The difficulty and anticipation of that period remain indelibly etched in my memory.

2020年七月，我终于从鲁汶大学毕业。为了前往奥斯陆，我特意到哥本哈根的挪威大使馆办理居留卡，因为那时荷兰和比利时的挪威领事馆均已关闭。尽管丹麦禁止比利时居民入境，我还是通过德国乘坐火车抵达了丹麦。在旅途中，我还经历了在汉堡中央火车站滞留一整夜的窘境，这些经历虽充满挑战，但也让我对自己的适应力和解决问题的能力有了更深的认识。

In July 2020, I graduated from KU Leuven. To move to Oslo, I made a special trip to the Norwegian embassy in Copenhagen - since the Norwegian consulates in the Netherlands and Belgium were closed due to the pandemic. Despite travel bans preventing Belgian residents from entering Denmark, I managed to enter Denmark via train from Germany. I even spent a whole night stranded at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof - a challenging, yet enlightening experience that deepened my understanding of my own resilience and problem-solving capabilities.

到达奥斯陆后的几个月，城市的封锁时断时续。初来乍到，我在博士项目中感到非常迷茫。课题与我以前的经验大相径庭，需要学习的东西很多，而且很多问题也不是那么明晰。回想起来，那一年的艰难和迷茫，对我来说是一次深刻的生命体验。

The initial months in Oslo were marked by intermittent city lockdowns. As a newcomer, I found myself bewildered by my PhD project. The topics were far removed from my previous experiences, requiring me to learn a great deal and navigate through unclear waters. Looking back, that first year was tough and confusing, but profoundly formative.

2022年，我在荷兰进行了两段实习，第一段在Twente大学，第二段则是在我现在的公司。这两段经历极大地丰富了我的专业知识和工作经验，也使我对荷兰有了更深的好感。同年，随着疫情在欧洲的缓解，我们整个项目组终于在马德里实现了首次面对面的聚会，那是一次充满喜悦的经历。

In 2022, I completed two internships in the Netherlands - one at Twente University and the other at the company where I currently work. These stints significantly enriched my professional knowledge and work experience, and left me with a favorable impression of the Netherlands. That same year, as the pandemic waned across Europe, our project team finally met in person in Madrid, a joyous and memorable gathering.

在这三年的博士生涯中，时间的流逝给我留下了深刻的印象，仿佛是在提醒我，每一段经历，无论是成功还是挫败，都是生命中不可或缺的篇章。在挑战与困境中，我学会了不仅要有耐心等待问题的解决，更重要的是在等待中寻找解决问题的钥匙。这种耐心不仅仅是被动地承受时间的流逝，而是一种主动的、深思熟虑的对策略调整与自我提升的追求。

通过不断地自我反省和学习，我发现，对于困难的面对方式也逐渐从焦虑和急躁转变为冷静和理性。在面对诸如实验失败、理论瓶颈或是人际关系的摩擦时，我学会了将这些挑战视为自我成长的机会。这种心态的转变，并非一蹴而就，而是在每一次深呼吸、每一次暂退一步、每一次深入思考之后，逐渐养成的习惯。

更深层次的，这段时间让我体会到了时间的宝贵。每一个现在，都是未来回忆的基石。因此，即使在科研的漫长道路上，我也学会了珍惜与同行者的每一次交流、每一个研讨会的讨论以及每一次国际会议的见闻。这些经历在塑造我的学术生涯的同时，也丰富了我的人生视野。

Reflecting on my three years of doctoral study, the passage of time stands out sharply, reminding me that every experience, whether filled with success or setbacks, is an integral chapter of life. Amidst these challenges, I learned the importance of not just waiting patiently for solutions, but actively seeking keys to unlock these puzzles. This kind of patience is not merely enduring the passage of time, but a proactive, thoughtful pursuit of strategy adjustment and self-improvement.

Through continuous self-reflection and learning, I've found that my approach to handling difficulties has shifted from anxiety and impatience to calmness and rationality. Facing issues like failed experiments, theoretical bottlenecks, or interpersonal conflicts, I've learned to view these challenges as opportunities for personal growth. This shift in mindset wasn't instantaneous but developed gradually through deep breaths, stepping back, and deep thinking.

More profoundly, this period has taught me the value of time. Every present moment is the foundation for future memories. Even on the lengthy road of academic research, I've learned to cherish every interaction with colleagues, every discussion at seminars, and every insight at international conferences. These experiences have shaped my academic career and broadened my perspective on life.

因此，回望过去的三年，我不仅仅看到了一个学术上成长的自己，更看到了一个在生活各方面都获得了宝贵经验的自己。面对未来，无论是职业道路上的选择还是个人生活的规划，这段经历都赋予了我更多的信心和冷静，让我相信无论面对什么样的挑战，我都有能力去应对，去克服。这份从容不仅是博士生涯的收获，更是一种生活的智慧。

Looking back over these three years, I see not only academic growth but also a personal evolution in many aspects of life. Facing the future, whether choosing a career path or planning personal life, this journey has endowed me with greater confidence and equanimity, empowering me to face and overcome whatever challenges may come. This composure is not just a doctoral gain but a profound life wisdom.
