## Life in Five Lands: A Journey Through Code and Culture

Hello and welcome! I'm Feiyang, a curious explorer both in the digital and physical realms. This is my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts on technology, travel, and the many intersections in between.

### My Journey in Academia and Beyond

After earning my Ph.D., I've moved into the software industry, serving as a consultant. My academic background is diverse and interdisciplinary:

- **Bachelor's, University of Auckland, 2019**: \ 
[Adaptive Self-Sufficient Itemset Miner for Transactional Data Streams](/assets/pdf/UOA_thesis.pdf)\
- **Master's, KU Leuven, 2020**: \
[Image-text Alignment for Artworks](/assets/pdf/KUL_thesis.pdf)\
- **Ph.D., Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 2023**: \
[Analyzing Privacy in Software (abstract ONLY before defence)](/assets/pdf/Thesis_abstract.pdf)\

Feel free to explore these areas if they catch your interest.

### Bridging Disciplines in the Industry

While I've pivoted towards the software industry, my love for research, new ideas, and innovation remains steadfast. I find immense value in applying my interdisciplinary knowledge—spanning AI, software engineering, and privacy research—to real-world applications.

### A Multicultural Lens

Living in five different countries has given me an intricate understanding of the symbiosis between technology and multiculturalism. I value diversity not just as a cultural asset but as a vital ingredient in technological innovation.

### Beyond the Screen

Away from the keyboard, I revel in life's simpler joys. You'll often find me perfecting the art of coffee brewing or setting off on solo adventures to discover the world's hidden treasures.

### Museums and Mindfulness

Museums serve as my sanctuary, where I meander through time and art, enriching both my personal and professional perspectives.

### Engage and Share

This website is a venue for both the technical and the personal, the analytical and the emotional. So go ahead, grab your favorite brew, and let's journey through this complex, beautiful world together. I welcome your stories and viewpoints; they form the fabric of our shared digital narrative.

Thank you for stopping by. May this space offer a moment of inspiration and a spark of curiosity for what lies ahead. Let's navigate the multifaceted worlds of technology and culture, stitching together a future as intricate as the codes we write and the stories we live.
